This a student-made template following the thesis template guidelines of Gebze Technical University\cite{gtustyle}. I decided to create it out of frustration that a \emph{technical, research-focused} university does not have a proper \LaTeX~ template, where most publications encourage on using \LaTeX~ to make it easier to comply, and instead opt into an old outdated MSWord template.

The template is a recreation of the original MSWord template, and not in any way a new thing. The reason behind that is that despite it being easier to create a template from the ground up, it is harder to convince the administration of moving to a new territory, not to mention that I am pro-choice, (I want people to choose \LaTeX~ over MSWord, not for \LaTeX~ to be imposed upon them like MSWord was imposed upon us,) and I am not ready to create an MSWord template.

Big thank you to Asst. Prof. Zafeirakis Zafeirakopoulos for encouraging me to start the project, Melike İlteralp for helping me in the first steps, Sibel Gülmez for creating the undergrad cover page (although I have refactored it, it is still based on her work), Asst. Prof. Alp Arslan Bayrakçı for giving the use of the template a green light for the undergraduate students (Autumn 2021) and giving me some feedback ideas on how to improve it, which alongside the feedback of numerous students who used it that semester led to the improved V.2 where I have moved from a package with a lot of functions to a class with most things defined there, which was inspired by the IEEEtran class.

%% Until here

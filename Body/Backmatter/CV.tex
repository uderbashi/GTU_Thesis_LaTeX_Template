I am Usama I. I. Derbashi, a graduate from the department of Computer Engineering in Gebze Technical University. I have started my studies there in Autumn 2017, and I have graduated in Spring 2022.

One of my frustrations, which I have heard my graduate-level friends at the uni complain about was the horrible MSWord template, which they were expected to follow. One friend said they reviewed his work once and sent it back for some slider he nudged by mistake. My friends mostly used \LaTeX~for their publications, and it seemed to be easy to move work between a draft for the thesis and for a conference, and with MSWord you lose a lot of this interoperability between different works and projects. Plus, a \LaTeX~template once set, the writer no longer thinks a lot about the issues of formatting and only focuses on what is important\dots writing. And that's why I decided to do this.
